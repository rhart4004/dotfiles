Flipped Classroom
==================
test
Introduction
-------------

Hook, get students curious, how is this connected to the real world

Learning Objects
------------------

What is expected to learn in the lesson
More for the teacher than the student
Becomes like the thesis of a paper

Specific - who, what, when and under what conditions will you use these
Measurable - list, state, demonstrate, critique, explain, describe (measurable behaviors)
Attainable
Relevant
Targeted - make sure that your objective is on the correct level of Bloom's taxonomy

Bloom's Taxonomy

1. Remembering
2. Understanding
3. Applying
4. Analyzing
5. Evaluating
6. Creating

Lecture Notes
-------------

Mind map of how things are related to each other (prezi), provides students a mental model to connect ideas

Readings for Lecture
--------------------

Textbooks, articles, literature that would be used by experts in practice

Pre-test with and without Feedback
-----------------------------------

Very low stakes, pass/fail, do more than once, tests basic understanding of concepts gained in
readings, and lecture notes

Actual Class
-------------

Role play, scripted scenerio, physical examples, work together to figure out a problem (in small groups)
Then re-gather and compare notes/solutions on/to the problems
Gets them actually engaged
Better than passive lecture, now active learning

Learning Activities/Guided Practice
-----------------------------------

Real active learning!

Post-test
----------

The final assessment to find out if the student did what was supposed to be done

Alignment
-----------

Objectives -- Readings/Lectures -- Learning Activities (practice) -- Assessments

** make sure that all of these are aligned perfectly!

Gain Attention
Share Objectives
Elicit Prior Knowledge
Share content & Provide Guidance
Elicit Performance - student responds
Provide Feedback (correct misunderstandings and deepen understanding)
Assess Performance (test or writing activity)
Transfer of knowledge (uses the knowledge)
