core - styles - bootstrap

used in cockpit visual menu picker

verify alert working just as a label

no buttons yet...

some need separate class....some can be lumped into smartclient objects

we want to use bootstrap for visual only...not functional

all of this is in reference to the email

on another note: create shortcuts for bootstrap glyphicons in vim using ultisnips (maybe for font awesome too)

separate icon class for bootstrap and font awesome
